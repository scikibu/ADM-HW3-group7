# ADM-HW3-group7
In this assignment we have analyzed text of Airbnb property listings in Texas. We got the information used from *Airbnb_Texas_Rentals.csv*, downloaded as requested from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas).  
We implemented all the four steps, creating a simple seach engine and then improving it, with cosine similarity and new scoring function.
In conclusion, we put a visualisation that allows the search on the map.
